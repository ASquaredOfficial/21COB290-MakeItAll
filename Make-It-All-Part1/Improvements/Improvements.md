#### Feedback Questions
Some of the questions:
<br />Q1. As a manager of the team, how would a manager be able to keep track of progress of the team and task
<br />Q2. Do we have due dates for the tasks?
<br />Q3. How do we see how many tasks are finished/incomplete in terms of database or helpdesk page etc.?
<br />Q4. If any specialist goes on holiday or sickness leave, is there a way to add that to the system so we're not assigning issues to specialists who arent available?
<br />Q5. In trerms of equipment, is there any way that a user or specialist can add the helpdesk be able to edit the list of verified and good software and hardware when we transfer between equipment.
<br />Q6. How is security in terms of if i press back will someone be able to get back into the website?
<br />Q7. Click too many times!!
<br />Q8. How will the operator find out that a problem is unresolved or the specialist was unable to solve an issue to reassign the issue?
<br />Q9. Theres no data analysis, a way of seeing that x hardware/spftware has been causing lots of problems, so consider dropping that software

#### Teamwork planning and delegation
Teamwork planning and delegation:
<br />- (Q3)A good thing to add will be the arranging in terms of the type of the task and then maybe priority of the tasks within that group
<br />- Gannt Charts to manage what tasks need to be done by who and by when

#### Helpdesk Page
Helpdesk Page:
<br />- A way to reopenand edit a a case once its been resolved
<br />- A register page once you've entered the details of an external specialist
<br />- A way to remove an external specialist from the database automatically after a set period of time
<br />- (Q8) Notification when a specialist was unable to solve the issue, so helpdesk operator can reassign when they see the notification

#### General Webpage
General Webpage:
<br />- Consider security in terms of being able to sign out and not press back.
<br />- Consider making the navigation bar stay highlighted once you've opened and stuck to a page the hover/shaded. It makes navigation easier
<br />- (Q7) When clicking on a column automatically sort
<br />- (Q7) When clicking on a row or button to automatically open the problem details, instead of going on another page, entering the number etc
<br />- (Q9) Increase data representation and data analysis of the problems, eg old software causing lots of problems. [consider this as a good extension of the webpage]
<br />- Use post instead of get when doing sql statements, especially with sensitive information
<br />- Develop using externall css first to save time later when trying to make everything external after, which causes unforseen problems.
<br />- Convery jQuery to JS as soon as you realise that you need to only use JS instead of leaving it to the last minute
<br />- Start developing with external JS than using internal, it make things look neater and better than moving everything to external at the last minute
<br />- Fix the order sort for the priotity so its not based off a  string but off a specific order
<br />------> eg. using this method: https://sqlandme.com/2013/11/18/sql-server-custom-sorting-in-order-by-clause/
<br />- Dynamically make dropdowns based off the specialist in the database
<br />------> eg. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9275972/creating-dropdown-dynamically-javascript 
<br />------> consider using the link above merging xml/sql/php/js
<br />- Style the dropdown so its similar works with the rest of the webpage (consistancy)
<br />- Consider using $_REQUEST so its easier to change code between GET and POST requests if need be
